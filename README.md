&nbsp;

Time always wins.

Our exploits are only brief victories,

but in those fleeting moments,

we own the system.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There isn't much time.

&nbsp;

You step back.

You analyze.

You think.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When everyone's running the same exploits,

who's left to discover what lies beneath?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We reject script kiddie solutions.

We study.

We marshal our intellect.

&nbsp;

Hours slip by,

we persevere.

&nbsp;

We strive to crack the uncrackable —

because that is what truly matters.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We are researchers and breakers.

Engineers and artists.

&nbsp;

So when Security insists on winning,

we find a way to push the boundaries even further.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

You may not see us,

but you'll always feel us.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We are **MindflareX**.
